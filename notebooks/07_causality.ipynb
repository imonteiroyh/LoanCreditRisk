    "# Causal Reasoning to Bridge Risk Models and Business Decisions\n",
    "This notebook provides a strategic overview of how lightweight causal reasoning can be practically applied to bridge predictive credit risk models with actionable business decisions. While the primary focus of credit models is risk ranking, actual business impact depends on understanding how changes to key levers — such as pricing and credit limit — might shape customer behavior and portfolio outcomes. In this context, causal inference offers a way to estimate and reason about the potential effects of different decisions, even when only observational or mocked data is available. The emphasis here is on deploying principled, transparent methods to enhance business judgment, rather than constructing fully prescriptive or experimental frameworks."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit risk models are typically designed to predict the probability of default conditional on observed borrower characteristics and an existing policy environment. While this is essential for ranking risk, it is not sufficient to directly answer business questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much profit would we gain by approving more users?\n",
    "* What is the optimal trade-off between higher risk and higher volume?\n",
    "* How should pricing or credit limits be adjusted to maximize long-term value?\n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge is that decisions themselves influence outcomes. Interest rates affect borrower affordability and repayment behavior. Credit limits affect utilization, exposure, and sometimes even demand. As a result, observed outcomes in historical data are endogenous to the decisions taken by the incumbent policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal reasoning provides a framework to reason about these feedback loops. Even when full causal identification is not possible, it helps structure assumptions, isolate mechanisms, and avoid naive interpretations of model outputs as direct business impact."

    "## Counterfactual Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "The core shift introduced by causal thinking is moving from prediction to counterfactual questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of asking:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “What is the default risk of this borrower?”\n",
    "\n",
    "We ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “What would happen *if we changed the decision* applied to this borrower?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples relevant to this setting include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approval counterfactuals\n",
    "\n",
    "  *What if we relaxed approval cutoffs by one score band?*\n",
    "  \n",
    "  How would default rates, volume, and total losses change?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pricing counterfactuals\n",
    "\n",
    "  *What if borrowers currently priced as subgrade E were instead priced like C?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  How would repayment behavior and portfolio performance respond?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limit counterfactuals\n",
    "\n",
    "  *What if we increased credit limits for low-risk borrowers?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  Would higher utilization and revenue outweigh the additional exposure?\n",

    "These are fundamentally causal questions: they ask about outcomes under alternative actions that were not historically taken for the same individuals."

    "## Lightweight Causal Methods (Practical and Defensible)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the absence of randomized approvals or pricing experiments in this dataset, we adopt lightweight causal tools that are transparent and assumption-driven, rather than attempting full structural identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity analysis evaluates how conclusions change under different, plausible assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume a range of elasticities of default with respect to monthly payment.\n",
    "* Recompute portfolio loss, approval volume, and expected return under each assumption.\n",
    "* Check whether conclusions (e.g., “model A dominates model B”) are robust across that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach does not claim point identification, but it answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Are our conclusions fragile or stable under reasonable economic assumptions?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bounds and Conservative Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "When effects cannot be precisely estimated, we can often bound them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Upper and lower bounds on default impact when increasing credit limits.\n",
    "* Worst-case vs best-case scenarios for borrowers moving into newly approved regions.\n",
    "* Conservative assumptions on take-up decline when interest rates increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounds are particularly useful for governance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If even the pessimistic bound looks acceptable, the decision is safer.\n",
    "* If conclusions flip depending on small assumption changes, caution is warranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partial Identification and Directional Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "In many business decisions, directionality is more important than precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Higher interest rates almost certainly increase default risk through payment burden.\n",
    "* Higher credit limits increase exposure, but also revenue potential and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "* More competitive pricing likely increases application volume, not just approval rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without exact magnitudes, partial identification allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* identify regions of potential upside,\n",
    "* detect where policy changes are likely dominated (high risk, low growth),\n",
    "* and focus experimentation where uncertainty and upside are both high."
